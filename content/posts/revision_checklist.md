Google has nice course on technical writing. It's text itself is example on how to apply advice you will learn there. I finished first part twice, because first time I just did exercises and not made any notes. Before starting second part I noticed that I forgot almost everything, so I retook it with also taking some notes. 

End of the course gives [short summary](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/summary), but here I'll give you mine checklist, which is a nice addition to [revision checklist from Academic and Business Writing](/posts/edx_writing/#drafting-and-revision). 

<!--more-->

* Define your audience. What they know, what they need to learn?
* Define unfamiliar terms or link to their definition.
* Use acronyms only if you define it first, it appears often in document and is significantly shorter than full text.
* Make sure pronouns are unambiguous. Replace them (pronouns) with nouns when necessary.
* Active voice is better then passive. 
* Avoid imprecise verbs - forms of "be", "occur", "happen". Remove "there is".
* Remove unnecessary words. Reduce wordiness.
  - Is able to -> can
  - at this time -> now
* Minimize adjectives and adverbs in educational texts.
* Avoid idioms. 
  - piece of cake -> easy
* Write short sentences. Each sentence should focus on single idea.
* Convert some long sentences to lists.
* Use bulleted lists for unordered items and numbered for ordered. If meaning of list changes from reordering - it should be numbered.
* Opening sentence of each paragraph should define what paragraph will be about.
* Each paragraph should be about separate topic.
* Each paragraph should answer 3 questions. (I am not very convinced about this). 
  1. *What* you are telling your reader?
  2. *Why* it is important? 
  3. *How* reader should use that knowledge? Or how should he know it is true? 
* Minimize use of parentheses. <del>(</del>They contain text that is not critical, so either text, or them could be removed.<del>)</del> 
* Turn on spellchecking. (My addition).


Vim users spellcheck like this:
```
:set spell spelllang=en_us
```

`]s` moves you to next misspelled word. `[s` - to previous. `z=` gives you a list of suggestions.
